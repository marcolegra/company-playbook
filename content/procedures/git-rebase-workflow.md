## Prerequisites and definitions

* `develop` is the *integration branch*
* *Redmine* is the issue tracker
* We are using the project *Agile Board* on our issue tracker
* We are using *Gitlab* as git server
* `REPO` is our project repository on git server (eg. gitlab@gitlab.sparkfabrik.com:sparkfabrik/company-playbook.git)

## Steps

Follow these steps to achieve code serenity:

### Daily work

* Clone repository: `git clone REPO`
* Pick the feature/user-story to work out from the Agile Board: say it is *#12345 - Integrate with billing server*
* Create a new branch with the following name convention: `feature/[#issue-id]_[feature_title-slug]` and move on it: `git checkout -b feature/12345_integrate_with_billing_server`
* Working the issue, always add your changes to the stage using `git add -p` and interactively rewiewing all changes (this is important when code is autogenerated and can overwrite other's work: i.e. a Drupal Feature)
* Commit your code with a message following this naming convention: `[#issue-id] - Commit message`: `git commit -m '#12345 - Admins can now store billing-id for a client'`
* Push it on a remote so that if your PC is blasted by aliens you can avoid being fired

### When your issue is done

* Fetch develop branch, keep integration branch fetched: `git fetch`
* Rebase your branch over develop: `git rebase origin/develop`
* Push to your branch: `git push -f` or better yet `git push -f origin feature/12345_integrate_with_billing_server`
* Head to Gitlab and open a MR from your branch towards `develop`
* Address possible feedback in your branch and keep pushing over it, Gitlab will update itself with your fixes
* When you are done the MR will be merged by a peer or gatekeeper
* Switch back on `develop` and reset to the latest develop: `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/develop`

Redo from start and live happy! :)

## Pro-tips

* When you open a branch to work out a user-story, and have to name it against the naming convention we exposed, consider that the title part is amendable at need, the issue-id *is not!*
* When you create a new commit, try to keep your message short but significant! `#12345 - More love` means nothing! A good rule of thumb is: don't write what you did (others can see the code by themselves) but *why you did it*
* If your work spans over a long time (days) we advice you rebase it onto develop at least daily: `git fetch && git rebase origin/develop` (solve conflicts if they arise and push with `-f` options).
* You can use an optional `-i` parameter when you rebase your branch onto develop, this way: `git rebase origin/develop`. In that case, you can pick only the commits you want to rebase, save and quit the interactive editor. Be warned: *there shall be dragons!*
