When a new team mate enters the company, she is assigned a buddy. Someone who helps her getting up to speed with our habits, processes, vocabulary, unwritten rules (if any) and that explain the overload of inside jokes we crack every day.

This is a very important task, usually carried out by seasoned sparkers. This page is a practical guidelines for both the buddy and the employee about what to focus on to make sure the first month in Sparkfabrik always is a valuable experience.

## The process

As every process, onboarding has inputs and outputs.

Inputs are the involved people and a set of clear goals.  
The output is a new team mate who can autonomously find her way within the company, providing valueable work and participating to the whole team life, with little to no friction.

There are prerequisites, of course. To make sure nothing is missing, it suffices to follow [this handy checklist](/procedures/employee-onboarding).

Once they are fulfilled, the next step is to set the goals and schedule check-ups.
